Repository w.r.t. Linear Operator Construction with Kalman Filter (LOCK)

- This repository includes linear operator construction with Kalman filter (LOCK), local LOCK (LLOCK), and spatially uniform LOCK (SLOCK).
- You can get detail about these methods at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11256)

# How to use
We provide examples in `examples` directory. For instance, if you would like to see results of damped oscillation model, please check `examples/damped_oscillation_model.py`.

Also, if you see generation process of our synthetic data, codes `examples/data_*.py` show that.

# Packages
Our code use `Python 3.7.3` and `numpy 1.17`.

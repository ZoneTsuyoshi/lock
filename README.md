# Linear Operator Construction with the Kalman Filter (LOCK)

- This repository includes linear operator construction with the Kalman filter (LOCK), local LOCK (LLOCK), and spatially uniform LOCK (SLOCK).
- You can get detail about these methods at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11256](https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.11256)

# How to use
- We provide 4 examples in `examples` directory.
    1. damped oscillation model (LOCK)
        - application of LOCK is conducted by `python damped_oscillation_model.py`
    2. object moving data (SLOCK)
        - the data is generated by `python data_object_moving.py`
        - application of SLOCK is conducted by `python object_moving.py`
    3. local stationary flow data (LLOCK)
        - the data is generated by `python data_local_stationary_flow.py`
        - application of SLOCK is conducted by `python local_stationary_flow.py`
    4. global flow data (LLOCK)
        - the data is generated by `python data_global_flow.py`
        - application of SLOCK is conducted by `python global_flow.py`
